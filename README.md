# Welcome to my portfolio webpage!
This repo is intended to house the code for my personal portfolio website, as well as document the process of me designing, coding, and hosting a web page for the first time!

## General Structure
This document has all the markup for the webpage. I started the page by creating a fixed navigation bar that allows for smooth scrolling when the user clicks on a section to view. To accomplish this, I added the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` and `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;` CSS tags to the `*` attribute. The rest of the document is split into 3 sections.

### About Section
This section includes my photo, a statement of where I'm from, and a statement explaining what I'm studying at Dartmouth. There is also a waving hand emoji that was created entirely using CSS animations!

### Skills Section
In this section, I've included a bit about some projects I've worked on as well as the languages I'm familiar with. I used `flex` elements to move the icons into place for this section.

### Contact Me Section
In this section, I preseent table of icon images, each of when is clickable and takes the user to a page where they can contact me. The shaking phone emoji was created as a pure CSS animation.
